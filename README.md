## Overview

📝 The "Text Adventure Engine" is a role-playing game (RPG) where players immerse themselves in a text-based fantasy world. This project was developed as part of my Class XII Computer Science curriculum. The game features character creation, combat encounters, inventory management, and a progression system, all implemented using Python.
